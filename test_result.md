# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

  Redesign the OI Change dashboard to match a reference image (title, "How to read this?" popover,
  Replay Change link, Show OI toggle, richer tooltip, timeframe pills like "Last 5 mins", bottom
  summary with Call OI change / Put OI change / Index-at-time prices). Then fix these follow-up
  issues reported by user:
    1) Chart is blank when switching to SENSEX (strike range not reset).
    2) Add "Last 1 min" and "Last 3 mins" pills.
    3) Expiries list must show max 4 rows visible with vertical scroll (Kite Live returns many).
    4) Strike range should auto-update when switching NIFTY / SENSEX / BANK.
    5) Card background should tint green when Put OI increases dominate, red when Call OI dominate,
       intensity proportional to how large the change is (very large -> strongly coloured).
    6) When user changes timeframe, immediately fetch data for that window; then keep polling every
       30 seconds regardless of timeframe.

      Please verify the five frontend fixes above via UI at REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL. Focus areas:
      1. Load dashboard, click SENSEX in the sidebar Index picker (button labelled "SENSEX"), wait
         ~4s. Confirm the OI chart renders (grouped Put/Call bars around ATM ~77000-78000). The
         "Strike Range" min/max inputs in the sidebar must update to values in the SENSEX range
         (~75000-79000), NOT the previous NIFTY values (23100-24600). Repeat for "BANK".
      2. In the OI Change tab, confirm the timeframe pills row now includes "Last 1 min" and
         "Last 3 mins" (in addition to the existing 5 mins ... Full Day). Click "Last 1 min" and
         confirm it becomes active (bg-slate-900 text-white) and a network request is made to
         /api/oi/NIFTY/change?minutes=1 (or SENSEX/BANKNIFTY depending on current index).
      3. In the sidebar, the "Expiries Included" section: with a Kite Live account many expiries
         are returned. Verify that only ~4 rows are visible at a time and the container scrolls
         vertically when there are more (data-testid="expiries-list").
      4. Observe the network tab: /api/oi/{index}/change should be called every ~30 seconds now
         (not 15). It should also fire immediately when the timeframe pill changes.
      5. The white card wrapping the chart should show a subtle green tint when Put OI change
         dominates and red tint when Call OI change dominates. Larger imbalance -> stronger tint
         (up to a green/red inset glow). No exact numeric threshold required; just confirm the
         tint changes with data.
      Auth: none. Demo mode is default; Live Kite is optional. All existing tabs (Open Interest,
      Strike Table, Alerts) should still work.
    -agent: "main"

      Round 3 fixes to verify:

      1) Toast colour for BULLISH backend alerts must be GREEN, not red.
         - Reproduce: wait for the AlertsPanel to receive a new alert whose `direction`
           starts with "Bullish". Watch the top-right Sonner toast. It must render
           with green styling (Sonner "success" variant with richColors) — NOT red.
         - Bearish alerts must still be red.
         - Fixed in Dashboard.jsx loadAlerts: chooses toast.success vs toast.error
           based on `a.direction.includes("bullish") || a.severity === "info"`.

      2) When "Full Day" pill is selected, the mini time-slider under the chart
         should show "9:15 AM" as the start label and current clock time as the end.
         - Check `[data-testid="window-start-label"]` after clicking `tf-full`. Must
           equal "9:15 AM".
         - For other timeframes (e.g. tf-15) the start label should equal the previous
           snapshot time (or current-15min if no previous). Just assert it exists
           and is not literally "9:15 AM" when a non-full timeframe is active with
           a valid snapshot present.

      3) NEW: Market Intel row above the "Change on ..." panel with 5 cells:
         Bias, PCR, Max Pain, Support, Resistance. Selectors:
           [data-testid="market-intel"]          (container)
           [data-testid="market-verdict"]        (BIAS pill)
           [data-testid="market-verdict-label"]  (label text)
           [data-testid="intel-pcr"]
           [data-testid="intel-max-pain"]
           [data-testid="intel-support"]
           [data-testid="intel-resistance"]
         Assert:
         - Container present after ~5s of data.
         - Verdict label is one of: "Strong Bullish", "Bullish", "Neutral",
           "Bearish", "Strong Bearish".
         - PCR value matches /^\d+\.\d{2}$/.
         - Max Pain, Support, Resistance values are integers (comma-formatted OK).
         - When switching index NIFTY → SENSEX, values update (Support/Resistance
           should reflect SENSEX strikes ~76000-78000, not NIFTY).

      All 3 fixes are frontend-only. No backend changes. No env changes. Auth: none.

      A) "Full Day" pill now == minutes since 9:15 AM IST (market open) — not a
         fixed 375. Test by clicking "Full Day" (data-testid="tf-full") and checking
         Network tab: the request `/api/oi/{index}/change?minutes=X` should have
         X ≈ (current IST clock in minutes from 9:15). Do not test the exact minute;
         just confirm X > 60 during regular market hours and reasonable.

      B) OI change values use adaptive units — small values like +300 now render
         as "+0.3K" instead of "+0.00L". Confirm the strings in `[data-testid="summary-ce-change"]`
         and `[data-testid="summary-pe-change"]` end with one of K, L or Cr (not always L)
         and never display "+0.00L" for non-zero deltas.

      C) A "OI last pulled at HH:MM:SS in last <timeframe>: PE +XL · CE +YL" line
         appears under the black "Change on <Day>" pill (data-testid="last-pull-change").
         The values should refresh on each 30s pull. Also a green pulsing dot with
         "Pulled HH:MM:SS" (data-testid="last-pulled") appears next to the "Show OI"
         switch in the chart card header.

      D) Frontend alert engine: when the aggregate |PE-CE| change relative to the
         base OI in the currently viewed timeframe is >= 35% intensity (very
         imbalanced), a Sonner toast should fire with title
         "<INDEX>: Bullish/Bearish pressure ... in last <timeframe>". Testing note:
         this requires actual live data with a big imbalance, which the demo mock
         may not always produce. Verify PROGRAMMATICALLY by evaluating window.
         `document.querySelector('[data-testid="oi-change-card"]').style.backgroundColor`
         to confirm the card tints react to the changeSummary; and by intercepting
         Sonner: check `document.querySelectorAll('[data-sonner-toast]')` occasionally.
         If no toast during the test window, just verify the code path exists
         (search Dashboard.jsx for "ALERT_INTENSITY" and confirm useEffect wiring).

      E) Backend alerts panel still populates on the right (data-testid absent —
         `/api/alerts` returns >= 1 alert now during live SENSEX / NIFTY runs, and
         the panel shows them). Just confirm the right-side "Alerts" section is
         non-empty after ~1-2 minutes of runtime OR the backend `/api/alerts`
         endpoint returns > 0 items.

      Do NOT modify env, do NOT touch backend. Auth: none.
